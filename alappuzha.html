The name stuck because of the black color of the statue. An unusual aspect of the statue is that it’s entire left side is missing. The rest of the statue has been recovered by the Archaeological Society of India and kept within a protected enclosure. The statue is credited with possessing several healing powers and the locals are still in great awe of the statue.Alappuzha is a wonderful city with plenty of interesting tourist attractions for you to see and enjoy. The best time to visit the city would be of course, during the November to March months because the climate would be just right, as the entire state would be in all glory and beauty after the monsoon season.</p>
