                            <p class="card-text">Gramam of Palakkad traces its history to the love story of a Kochi Prince who fell in love with a tribal girl of Palakkad. He was banished from his kingdom and the brahmins of Kochi refused to formalise the ceremonies when he settled in Palakkad. The prince did not give up and requested the brahmins from Tamil Nadu to oblige him. They did so and he settled down in Palakkad.The area which his people inhabited and its surroundings came to be known as gramam or agraharam. The gramam today encompass the areas of Kalapathy, Kumarapuram, Ramanathapuram, Ambikapuram, Chokkanathapuram. There are around 35 families that still follow the customs of the Tamil brahmins, viz., vedas and shashtras are passed down verbally from one generation to another.

The fort was originally constructed by Hyder Ali, Tipus father. However it fell into the hands of the British in 1784 and Zamorins in 1790.Today, the fort is under the protection and care of the ASI (Archaeological Survey  of . The fort is not only worth visiting because of its historical importance, rather it has a pleasant ambience that encourages you to take a walk in the evenings.

                            <p class="card-text">This temple can be visited on your way to the Jain Temple in Jainmedu. The presiding deity here is Bhagavathy, an incarnation of Kannagi, the heroine of Tamil epic Silappadhikaram. According to legends, it is believed that Kannagi, after burning the city of Madurai had taken rest under the fig tree in Vadakkanthara. An idol was formed in that place and since there was no roof above her she is also called Thirupurakkal Bhagawathy.In the evening, sharp at six, a small firework is set off as per the tradition (which can be witnessed in most of the other Keralite temples as well). The timing of the fireworks remains the same all the time, so much so that the people around have no qualms in setting their clock on hearing the sound of the crackers.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">This is the second of the two most important Bhagavathi devi temples in Palakkad. The temple is believed to be 1200 years old. The idol here is swayambhu (self created) and is found on one side of the Sreekovil. The main idol of the temple was installed at a much later date. It is located on the Palghat - Chittur road and is very near the national highway.As per the legends Manapulli Bhagavathy is Bhadrakaali who was born out of Lord Shiva’s sacred Jada during the Dakshayaga. The goddess is believed to have killed Neelan, the Asura, after which she became Manapulli Bhagavathy, to bless her devotees.The Manapullikaavu Vela Festival is the main festival of the temple. This is celebrated during the last week of February or the first week of March. The temple is open between 6 to 10.30 am and 5 to 7 pm.
