It is a quiet place where scenic beauty, wild life and tradition matter, simplicity is a virtue and beauty still blossoms from the mountainous horizon and from the green glaze of alluring vegetation. Clean and pristine, enchanting and hypnotizing, this land has a history and mystery, culture and social epistemology yet to be discovered. Located at a distance about 76 km from the sea shores of Calicut in the Western Ghats, this station is full of plantations, forests and wildlife. Wayanad hills are contiguous to Mudumalai in Tamil Nadu and Bandhipur in Karnataka, thus forming a vast land mass for the wild life to move about in its most natural abode.</p>
